**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md summarizing the results

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

My model is based on the NVIDIA CNN Architecture which consists of 9 layers, including a normalization layer, 5 convolutional layers, and 3 fully connected layers. Furthermore, the model has 5x5 and 3X3 filter sizes and depths between 2 and 64 (model.py lines 231-256). I modified the NVIDIA architecture a bit by adding dropout. 

The model includes ELU layers to introduce nonlinearity (code lines 242-246 and 251-253 ), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 239). 

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting

The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py line 247). 

I increased the dataset by implementing a few data augmentation techniques and this help to reduce overfitting and made the model generalize better. Additional data was generated by flipping, brightness, random shadow, random blur, image rotation, image shift and image flipping. The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle  stayed on the track.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 284). I used a batch size of 128

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. To keep the car in the center of the track, I used both left and right camera images and adjusted the steering angle by a fixed value any time the car veered leftward or rightward. I ensured the training data is normalized within the model itself. On training the network, I got good result at the fifth epoch because my validation loss was less than my training loss. I also experienced a reduction in loss for both training and validation data from epoch to epoch. The car drove round the track in autonomous mode perfectly. 



For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the NVIDIA architecture. I thought this model might be appropriate because it has demonstrated the ability to learn the task of lane detection and road tracking without having to use multiple computer vision techniques such as lane marking detection, path planning and so on. The model is able to learn so much with so less data as well as sparse features i.e steering measurement alone. 


In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my data set into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting initially. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model by adding dropout to the architecture, and ensured that my training data was good, I jettisoned my self generated training data for the udacity data set, which I believe exhibit better driving behaviour than mine.

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track, to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I used both the left and right side camera images to recover the car to the middle of the lane when it is veering off road. I also increased my dataset by flipping every image and ajusting the image brightness.

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes - 9 layers, including a normalization layer, 5 convolutional layers, and 3 fully connected layers.

Here is a visualization of the architecture :

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I used the provided dataset. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

I then used the left and right image and adjusted the steering angle to make the vehicle recover from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to stay in the middle of the road. These images show what a recovery looks like :

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles as well as image brighness and these help to increase the dataset. 


After the collection process, I had 28,655 number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by applying data normalization on every image as well as cropping the images from 160X320 to 66X200 which is what the NVIDIA architecture expects. See lines 237 to 239



I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 5 as evidenced by line 371 and passed to the nb_epoch parameter in the fit method on line 405. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.

#### 3. Further Work

I noticed in an attempt to increase the size of the data set further through various data augmentation techniques and adding my own generated dataset, the system ran-out of memory. I intend to implement python's generators to handle such memory constraints in the future. I believe the generators with give me room to increase the data set tremendously and help the model to generalize even better. This will make the car drive well on the track 2.
